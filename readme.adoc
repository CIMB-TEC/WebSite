IMPORTANT: Use terminal git, not the bloated GUI version. 

The workflow is as follows:

. Pick an Issue
. Clone the code to local 
. Create new local issue branch
. Hack away
. Commit and push to a new server branch
. Create pull request
. (Solve feedback)

If you don't have git, run in Powershell with admin rights:

[source, powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
----

then

[source, powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
choco install git hub -y
----

Clone

[source, powershell]
----
git clone https://github.com/CIMB-TEC/WebSite.git
cd Website
----

Create new feature branch, the name should be the issue number in the format "GH-{ISSUENUMBER}". If multiple issues are solved on the same branch, separate them with a comma.

[source, powershell]
----
git checkout -b GH-{ISSUENUMBER}
git remote add personal https://github.com/USERNAME/WebSite.git
----

Begin making changes.  Once finished, add, commit and push changes.

IMPORTANT: The commit message (the string between the quotes) should follow this format:
[GH-{ISSUE NUMBER}] - {Changes} ] 

[source, powershell]
----
git add *
git commit -m '{COMMIT MESSAGE}'
# Be sure to replace with your username
git push --set-upstream personal dev
----

Create pull request
