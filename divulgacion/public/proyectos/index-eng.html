      <p>The proyect Advanced Driver Monitoring for Assistance System (ADMAS) tries to develop a new driving asistance service that works in an efficient way to a driver, depending on his/hers psycho-physical state.</p>
      <p>The system pretends to convert a Level 2 autonomous car, into a level 3 or 4, in other words, transforming a common car into a semi-autonomous one. This will be achived by implemmenting sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms that take control of the vehicle when the driver is not able to drive safely.</p>
      <p>To determine the psycho-physical state od the driver, the vehicle will have pre-isntalled biometric sensors that will measure phisical variables to determine the health state, and the emotions that the driver presents.</p>
      <p>The fusion of these sensors, will allow to determine if the vehicle should take the roll of the driver, in case that the driver's actions are not propper to a safe driving, or when any mental or health state, seems to be affected.</p> <h3 class="subtitle">Development Areas</h3>
      <div class="areas-Investigación">
        <div> <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
          <p>In this area, projects for the creaton of artificial intelligence, simulators, vision systems, image processing are developed with tools such as: Machine Learning, Computational Vision amonh others, with the porpse of creating Intelligent Systems for vehicles.</p>
        </div>
        <div> <b>Mechatronics</b>
          <p>Instrumentation projects for vehicles are used by means of mechatronic and control systems are developed. The goal is to achive non-intrusive vehicle instrumentantion with the purpose of generating a small level of system-modularity to allow almost any vehicle to be autonomous</p>
        </div>
        <div> <b>Energy</b>
          <p>Analysis and ingestigation of vehicle's energy improvment is done by means of combustion analysis, renwable energies use, electrical vehicle, vehicle dynamic, reading and communications systems improvement. By the use of the CAN network to improve the vehicle performance.</p>
        </div>
        <div> <b>Communication</b>
          <p>A global-standared network made by autonomous vehicles is made in this area, this is done by investigating, simulating and implimenting this systems. This is done to obtain and send critical and non-critical data between vehicles.</p>
        </div>
        <div> <b>Bioinstrumentation</b>
          <p>This area focuses on the analysis and psico-physical variable adquisition, by means of the seat's instrumentation, automovile's cabine and the driver itself. With these the emotional state, the activity, and the driver's position can be assumed, and certain passive or active driving assistance systems are activated.</p>

      <p>This projects seeks to develop and establish a liveable space, in which the emotions can be suggested by means of ambiental variables and pre-programmed positive estimulation. </p>
      <p>It uses a facial expresion's detection system, an electroencephalography system, that detects the brain's electrical responeses and a device that measures the electric restistance of the user's skin, all of these with the purpose of stablishing the phyhsiolocical and emocional state of the subject.</p>
      <p>With the subject state, variations in the enviroment occur(temperature, humidity, light intensity and tone) to take the subject to a desire state. </p>
      <p>A good example is to try to transition between being angry or sad to being neutral or happy, these results could be applied in an office, to improve the employees life quality and therefore their health, and by improving these, the system could also improve their efficiency</p>
      <p>The research areas that have been involved in the project are: Mechatronics, Telecomunications and Electrical Systems, Computer Science, Industrial Engeeniering, Biotechnology, Industrial Design, Architecture, Psychology, Marketing, and Estadistics</p> <h3 class="subtitle">Supervisors</h3>

    <div class="info">
      <p> The purpose of this project is to develop a space completely autonomous and isolated to study the vegetal growth, where environmental conditions could be measured constantly, and changed if needed to allow the growth of different plants. This system is a sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture, using acoustic stimulation to speed up the growth and production of vegetal specimens, eradicating the need of pesticide and fertilizer, also reducing the amount of water used to irrigate the plant.</p>
      <p>The system analyzes the environment in which the specimen will be exposed, by means of one temperature and humidity sensor and two sensors to check the earths humidity. For its development, it regulates the light, with a led light; and a fan to exchange gases from the inside to the outside of the space. Besides it has an audio system to expose the specimen to different types of acoustic stimulation, from specific frequencies to a recording.</p>
      <p>From this results, a comparison between a control specimen, one that has not been affected by any means; and the acoustic stimulated, to see the effect, either positive or negative, on growth rate and production. This is done to determine which conditions are better for the specimen, therefor more production, leading to more earnings in the same amount of time.</p>
      <p>This is a multi-discplinary project, with the integration of different areas to get a better result. Until now students of the careers of Biothecnology, Telecomunications and Electronic Systems, Mechatronics, Computers Science, Industrial Design, have participated. </p> <h3 class="subtitle">Developer</h3>
