Or how to get that little green lock on the top bar.

* So. Encryption is a big deal. Google doesn't index us if we are not encrypted.
* Credentials could be compromised if not encrypted.
* Clients can be attacked with no encryption.

*Encryption is a big deal.*

We get our certificates from Cloudflare. Accept no other.

I've technically set it up to last for around 15 years but in the case you need to change something for whatever reason...
there is an account at Cloudflare.com. You can ask the manager for the credentials to that. 

== Doing it all over again

* In short, you need to change the nameservers of the current hoster to the Cloudflare ones and make sure that every address related to the website is proxied through it.

* Also, every single instance of a link should begin with `https://` and not `http://`

. Create an account at CloudFlare
. Link your domain. There's a wizard on that
. Make sure that the domain and the `www` entry are proxied on the DNS records

. Once this is done, change the nameservers at whatever your hosting is.
