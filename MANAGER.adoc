Congrats on making it to the project manager position.
Few things you have to know

* This uses the feature https://stackoverflow.com/a/4258654[branch workflow]
* More info https://stackoverflow.com/a/4258654[here]

*You need to manage changes via dev branch and merge PRs
//TODO add pictures of PR accepting and feedbacking

* Once you've merged enough PR's to `dev`, you should be ready to get a new release going. 
First, create a PR from `dev` to master

then, merge the pull request:

Next, you need to push to the server:
* Use https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp[git ftp]

Download git ftp to your machine
Add the credentials:

    git config git-ftp.url "ftp://cimb.com.mx/public_html"
    git config git-ftp.user "FTP_USERNAME"
    git config git-ftp.password "FTP_PASS"

Sync with server 
    
    git ftp catchup

Once you've finished merging all changes from `dev` to `master`, pull and checkout `master` and do

    git ftp push

This will upload the files in an orderly fashion.
